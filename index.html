	<h1 style="text-align: center;">STUDENTS FOR AI USE</h1>

	<p style="text-align:center;">
		Welcome to the website for students for AI use. Recently, our school has implemented
		a new technology that blocks our ability to use generative AI while learning. We are <br> 
		outraged at the decision which is why we have decided to make this organization to protest
		this decison and show the advantages of AI use in education. <br> 
	</p>

	<h2>Principal Domsalla's Case</h2>
	<p>
		In a recent school board meeting, Principal Domsalla presented his argument supporting the ban to fellow board members.
		He argued that AI was too "uncontrollable of a tool" due to being unreliable in some cases and too much of a crutch in 
		other cases. He focused on rule utilitarianism, arguing that this ban over other less extreme bans of AI would provide
		more utility in the long run. We disagree STRONGLY with this argument and have many good reasons why we should be able
		to use these resources.

	<h3>Why We Should Be able to use AI in our classes</h3>
	<p>
		Us students believe that allowing AI use for learning would bring more utility to society. If students are able to use
		AI to enhance their intelligence, rather than replace it or displace it, that would bring more utility to society 
		overall. AI would be a useful tool to help eliminate assignments that are more busywork than anything else; it wouldn't 
		stop us from learning new things. 
	</p>

	<p>
		When us students are able to use AI as a tool for enhancing our learning, it helps out everyone. AI can explain things
		in useful and easy to understand language. It can adapt to our learning styles and provide feedback to both struggling
		and successful students. Students who fall behind, or don't understand things can use the AI as another source to try 
		and get a different explanation on the subject. Meanwhile, students who do are ahead can use AI to do more advanced 
		research on the topic, or use it to ask advanced questions beyond what we do in class.
