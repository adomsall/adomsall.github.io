	<h1 style="text-align: center;">STUDENTS FOR AI USE</h1>

	<p style="text-align:center;">
		Welcome to the website for students for AI use. Recently, our school has implemented
		a new technology that blocks our ability to use generative AI while learning. We are <br> 
		outraged at the decision which is why we have decided to make this organization to protest
		this decison and show the advantages of AI use in education. <br>

	<h2>Principal Domsalla's Case</h2>
	<p>
		In a recent school board meeting, Principal Domsalla presented his argument supporting the ban to fellow board members.
		He argued that AI was too "uncontrollable of a tool" due to being unreliable in some cases and too much of a crutch in 
		other cases. He focused on rule utilitarianism, arguing that this ban over other less extreme bans of AI would provide
		more utility in the long run. We disagree STRONGLY with this argument and have many good reasons why we should be able
		to use these resources.
