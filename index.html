	<h1 style="text-align: center;">STUDENTS FOR AI USE</h1>

	<p style="text-align:center;">
		Welcome to the website for students for AI use. Recently, our school has implemented
		a new technology that blocks our ability to use generative AI while learning. We are <br> 
		outraged at the decision which is why we have decided to make this organization to protest
		this decison and show the advantages of AI use in education. <br> 
	</p>

	<h2>Principal Domsalla's Case</h2>
	<p>
		In a recent school board meeting, Principal Domsalla presented his argument supporting the ban to fellow board members.
		He argued that AI was too "uncontrollable of a tool" due to being unreliable in some cases and too much of a crutch in 
		other cases. He focused on rule utilitarianism, arguing that this ban over other less extreme bans of AI would provide
		more utility in the long run. We disagree STRONGLY with this argument and have many good reasons why we should be able
		to use these resources.

	<h3>Why We Should Be able to use AI in our classes</h3>
	<p>
		Us students believe that allowing AI use for learning would bring more utility to society. If students are able to use
		AI to enhance their intelligence, rather than replace it or displace it, that would bring more utility to society 
		overall. AI would be a useful tool to help eliminate assignments that are more busywork than anything else; it wouldn't 
		stop us from learning new things. 
	</p>

	<p>
		When us students are able to use AI as a tool for enhancing our learning, it helps out everyone. AI can explain things
		in useful and easy to understand language. It can adapt to our learning styles and provide feedback to both struggling
		and successful students. Students who fall behind, or don't understand things can use the AI as another source to try 
		and get a different explanation on the subject. Meanwhile, students who do are ahead can use AI to do more advanced 
		research on the topic, or use it to ask advanced questions beyond what we do in class. This AI ban removes these 
		benefits, making it harder to learn and potentially stalling our education. It would be useful to teachers 
		as well because if mulitple kids have questions or the teacher is struggling to reach the whole class, kids would 
		just be able to use AI to have more personalized help. it would provide everyone with a better educational experience, 
		which would bring more utility in the long run.
	</p>
        
	<p>
		We also must bring up that AI is used in almost every facet of our lives. The modern workforce is becoming increasingly
		reliant on AI and machine learning tools. When we are not allowed to use these tools, we are not being prepared for 
		future careers where using these tolls are essential. This ban creates a gap between our education and the demands of the 
		real world, which will reduce long term utility for both us students and the rest of society. 
	</p>
		
	<p>
		If we are to explore this rule as Principal Domsalla did in his argument, we have to look at it through the framework of 
		utilitarianism, specifically rule utilitiarianism. We argue that this current rule will NOT bring the most utility compared
		to other potential rules that could be enforced. We understand that AI is a very difficult tool for educators to work with. 
		It is difficult to control, and there are students who take advantage of it. This is why we believe that a partial ban of AI
		would bring the most utility to society. Instead of banning AI completely, teachers should show students how to most effectively
		use it for each of their classes so that it is assisting our learning. This would help prevent students unknowingly using it
		to do to much of their learning for them. Policies that limit AI use to supportive, not substitutive, rules would maximize 
		educational gains without undermining students' cognitive development. A rule like this would bring more utiltily than a full
		AI ban because it would be able to add another complex aspect of learning, expanding students repetoire of skills when it comes
		to education. Meanwhile the AI ban would take this away from students comletely, not even giving students the chance to learn 
		how to best use the tool for their learning. If students are able to use these tools, they would be able to learn and experiment
		with them. We students recognize the threat of becoming too dependent on these resources. We understand that we will be asked
		to do many assignments without AI to truly test our knowlege and reasoning skills. The partial ban would be the best for this. 
		It would offer the most utility because students would be able to use a helpful tool and teachers would be able to fairly 
		asses students' knowledge. Finally, when it comes to potential misuse of AI, we believe that even if students try to break the 
		rules of a partial ban, it would still bring the most utility to everyone overall. Students cheating with AI would be no 
		different than students cheating by getting the answers from someone else, or plagairizing a source that they found on the 
		internet. The ban is just making students rely on other sources. It is unfair to take a way a tool like AI because any tool 
		can be misused.
