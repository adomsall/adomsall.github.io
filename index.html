	<p style="text-align:center;">
		Welcome to the website for students for AI use. Recently, our school has implemented
		a new technology that blocks our ability to use generative AI while learning. We are <br> 
		outraged at the decision which is why we have decided to make this organization to protest
		this decison and show the advantages of AI use in education. <br>
