	<p>
		Welcome to the website for students for AI use. Recently, our school has implemented
		a new technology that blocks our ability to use generative AI while learning. We are 
		outraged at the decision which is why we have decided to make this organization to protest
		this decison and show the advantages of AI use in education.
